# Instructions
Print with minimum 50% infill in ABS or similar.
Use 6 x M4 nuts which are either self-locking or add loctite to ensure that blades do not fall off. 

The diameter of the 240mm disc here is max, and requires removing the shield behind the disc.
With the max allowable diameter you will get closer to the edge when cutting, and that is the main purpose !
